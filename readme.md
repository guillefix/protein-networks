So for an assignment we had to do, I made this interactive network of protein domains. You can click on any of the nodes to see the structure. The links represent the fact that the two domains share a common structural motif.

More information in the paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071170

You can also add /making_net/ to see how the network in another paper http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004466 are made :)
